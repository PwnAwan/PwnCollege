There are two files in some challenges. So, read the challenge file by typing /challenge/embryoio_level5. and then /challenge/checker.py
This challenge input is redirecting from a specific path /tmp/cggrnc. The challenge will check the hardcroded password over stdin. 
The password in this case is "mgukdapc".
Go to /tmp as cd /tmp. Create file with the given password input in file as 
echo "mgukdapc" > cggrnc
Then type /challenge/embryoio_level5 < /tmp/cggrnc and hit enter
The flag will show up.
