There are two files in this challenge. So, read the challenge file by typing /challenge/embryoio_level26 and then /challenge/checker.py.
The challenge will check that input is redirected from a specific file path : /tmp/dkxwxj
The challenge will check for a hardcoded password over stdin : nqsotmwk
name ipython.py
from pwn import *
import os
import sys
with open("/tmp/dkxwxj", 'w') as f:
    f.write("nqsotmwk")
fd = os.open("/tmp/dkxwxj", os.O_RDONLY)
p = process(["/challenge/embryoio_level26"],stdin=fd)
print(fd)
p.interactive()
Run the script as python ipython.py 
The flag will show.
