There are two files in this challenge. So, read the challenge file by typing /challenge/embryoio_level14 and then /challenge/checker.py.
In addition to creating the script, an empty environment variable is also required in this challenge. 
We need to create a shellscript file in /tmp/ directory with the following content.
name shellscript.sh
" #!/bin/bash 
env -i /challenge/embryoio_level14 "
Then change the permissions by using the following:
chmod +x shellscript.sh 
./shellscript.sh
The flag will show.
