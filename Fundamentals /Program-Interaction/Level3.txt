There are two files in all challenges. So, read the challenge file by typing /challenge/embryoio_level3. and then /challenge/checker.py
When you read the file then there is a password at line 3 as (NUM:VALUE) just copy the value and then type:
/challenge/embryoio_level3 ixlpqiizqc (ixlpqiizqc is a password in my case).
You will see the flag.
