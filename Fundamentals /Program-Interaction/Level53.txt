Read the challenge file by typing /challenge/embryoio_level53
The challenge checks for a specific parent process : ipython
The challenge checks for a specific process at the other end of stdin : rev
The challenge will check for a hardcoded password over stdin : iwwfczzn
I use ipython python.py but it doesn't shows the flag. Then I type simple ipython in terminal and then paste the belwo code. 
Write the script code as:
import subprocess as sp
x = sp.Popen(['rev'], stdout=sp.PIPE, stderr=sp.PIPE)
o = sp.Popen(['rev'], stdin=x.stdout, stdout=sp.PIPE, stderr=sp.PIPE)
out = sp.Popen(['/challenge/embryoio_level53'], stdin=o.stdout, stdout=sp.PIPE)
r, e = out.communicate()
print(r.decode())
Then enter the password, in this case "iwwfczzn".
After entering the password it doesn't show the flag. You need to press ctrl+d to view the flag.
The flag will show.
