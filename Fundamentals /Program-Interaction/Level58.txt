Read the challenge file by typing /challenge/embryoio_level58
The challenge checks for a specific parent process : python
The challenge checks for a specific process at the other end of stdout : cat
The challenge will check for a hardcoded password over stdin : nvvbglzi
Write the script.py code as:
import subprocess as sp
x = sp.Popen(['cat'], stdout=sp.PIPE, stderr=sp.PIPE)
# o = sp.Popen(['rev'], stdin=x.stdout, stdout=sp.PIPE, stderr=sp.PIPE)
out = sp.Popen(['/challenge/embryoio_level58'], stdin=x.stdout, stdout=sp.PIPE)
r, e = out.communicate()
print(r.decode())
Run the command as python script.py and enter the password, in this case "nvvbglzi"
The flag will show.
