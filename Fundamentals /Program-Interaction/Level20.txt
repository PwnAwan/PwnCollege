There are two files in this challenge. So, read the challenge file by typing /challenge/embryoio_level20 and then /challenge/checker.py.
In this challenge, we must redirect the input at this path "/tmp/ktcwzq" 
name ipython.py
from pwn import *
import os
# with open("/tmp/ktcwzq", 'w') as f:
fd = os.open("/tmp/ktcwzq", os.O_RDWR)
print(fd)
p = process(["/challenge/embryoio_level20"],stdout=fd)
with open("/tmp/ktcwzq", 'r') as f:
    print(f.read())
p.interactive()
Run the script as python ipython.py 
The flag will show.
