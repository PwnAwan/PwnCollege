There are two files in this challenge. So, read the challenge file by typing /challenge/embryoio_level16 and then /challenge/checker.py.
In this challenge requires ipython to run the program, but directly enter ipython and use the command. 
We need to create an ipython file in /tmp/ directory with the following content.
name ipython.py
import subprocess;subprocess.run(["/challenge/embryoio_level16"])
Run the script as python ipython.py and in running state enter the password given in challenge file. In my case it is "hiztkqkv"
The flag will show.
