There are two files in this challenge. So, read the challenge file by typing /challenge/embryoio_level12 and then /challenge/checker.py.
In addition to creating the script, input redirection is also required in this challenge.

We need to create a shellscript file in /tmp/yujbjc directory with this password "uphcfwxv" with the following content.
name shellscript.sh
" #!/bin/bash 
echo "uphcfwxv" > /tmp/yujbjc
/challenge/embryoio_level12 < /tmp/yujbjc "
Then change the permissions by using the following:
chmod +x shellscript.sh 
./shellscript.sh
The flag will show.
