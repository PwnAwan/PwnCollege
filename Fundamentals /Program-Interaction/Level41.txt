Read the challenge file by typing /challenge/embryoio_level41
The challenge checks for a specific parent process : bash
The challenge checks for a specific process at the other end of stdin : rev
The challenge will check for a hardcoded password over stdin : sitzffbr

//Compile and run the script as:
//gcc script.c -o bash
Type rev | /challenge/embryoio_level41 and hit enter.
enter the password in reverse order as "rbffztis". 
But it doesn't show the flag. Just enter ctrl+d to view the flag. In this challenge ctrl+d terminate the process but still the flag doesn't show in VSCode terminal. I use ssh connection and it works.
The flag will show.
