There are two files in this challenge. So, read the challenge file by typing /challenge/embryoio_level28 and then /challenge/checker.py.
The challenge will check that the environment is empty (except LC_CTYPE, which is impossible to get rid of in some cases)
name ipython.py
import subprocess 
subprocess.run(["/challenge/embryoio_level28"], env={})
Run the script as python ipython.py 
The flag will show.
