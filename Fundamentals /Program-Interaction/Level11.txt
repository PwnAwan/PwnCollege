There are two files in this challenge. So, read the challenge file by typing /challenge/embryoio_level11. and then /challenge/checker.py.
This challenge is also a shellscript challenge but protected by parameter with password.
We need to create a shellscript file in /tmp directory with the following script or content in the file.
name shellscript.sh
#!/bin/bash
/challenge/embryoio_level10 mnxlozbnvg 
Then change the permissions by using:
chmod +x shellscript.sh 
./shellscript.sh
The flag will show.
