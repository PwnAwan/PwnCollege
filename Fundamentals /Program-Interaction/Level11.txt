There are two files in this challenge. So, read the challenge file by typing /challenge/embryoio_level11 and then /challenge/checker.py.
This challenge is also a shellscript challenge In addition to creating the script, you also need to add environment variables.
We need to create a shellscript file in /tmp directory with the following script or content.
name shellscript.sh
" #!/bin/bash
export kcvlbo=bahmwxzpyn 
/challenge/embryoio_level11 "
Then change the permissions by using the following:
chmod +x shellscript.sh 
./shellscript.sh
The flag will show.
